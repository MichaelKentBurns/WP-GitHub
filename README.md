# WP-GitHub
##Tips, techniques, and tools to backup and monitor changes to a WordPress site using Git and GitHub.

This is one of several research and development projects I pursue at my Bible.MichaelKentBurns.com site.

At present this is just to capture the manual BASH and git based tools I use for several hosted WordPress sites.
Those tools are captured in the SHELL/bash directory with it's own bash.md document.

In the future, I would like to package it up as a more formalized tool, potentially in a WordPress plugin.
